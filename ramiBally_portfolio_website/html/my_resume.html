        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>I’m a college student looking for experience in technology and an opportunity to gain knowledge of common industry
            programming practices while in school. I’m focused on my goals and always willing to collaborate on projects with my
            colleagues to maximize efficiency. I'm also ambitious and willing to continue learning new programming languages
            that I can add to my repertoire.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>In my free time I like to do a few things. 
            I really like playing video games, the genre’s I spend most of my time playing are Tactical shooters (Counter-Strike & Valorant) and all types of rpg’s (mmo, single player, fantasy, historical fiction, etc.). 
            aside from video games I go to the movies every week with friends. A big series we follow are the MCU movies but we’re bigger fans of DC and I personally like the occasional artsy film from time to time like The Green Knight. 
            Finally I like reading books, I am currently reading a history of the crusades so I can settle an argument I’m having with a friend of mine.</p>
