    <p>This video is a very good review of the new remaster of the ps2 era grand theft auto games. The remaster added a nice coat of paint to a poorly aging trilogy as well as cleaned up the ui for more modern machines. However, this remaster was, in my opinion, done very poorly. The review shown is very lenient on rockstar when it came to calling out technical problems the games have but these shortcomings are not acceptable, especially coming from a company like rockstar that has as much disposable income as they have. Seeing the gameplay and glitches the game has really does show how little the company cared for the game and were just trying to make a rerelease in time for the holiday season to pad out their Q4 profits. It’s sad to see but it’s commonplace these days with AAA gaming to release broken or unfinished products and either forget about them or try to update them later. The consumers really 
        need to revolt against these corporations and stop letting them spoon feed us garbage wrapped in nostalgia or else it will only get worse. Pretty soon there will be no newer IP’s being released but just remaster after remaster and they’ll all be awful.</p>
